# The application of LLM prompt engineering to optimize title screening 
If you have to write a systematic review or meta-analysis, you need to search in detail for relevant documents to ensure a comprehensive overview. ASReview is the tool developed at Utrecht University that assists researchers during the paper screening phase. By looking at the titles and abstracts, ASReview identifies the most relevant papers and discards the irrelevant ones based on the topic of your review.
The goal of this project is to use prompt engineering to instruct Large Language Models (LLMs) to discard irrelevant research papers only based on their titles.
