You are screening papers for a systematic literature review.
The topic of the systematic review is trajectory analysis of PTSD.
The study should focus exclusively on this topic.
Decide if the article should be included or excluded from the systematic review.
I will give you the title of the article as input.
If the paper should be included label it as 1, if the paper should be excluded label it as 0. Your answer should only include the label number.
Exclude the papers if their title is about the following topics: review study; protocol in the title; purely biological study; animal study; psychometric study; qualitative study; case or report study; narrative (approach) study; methodological study; cross-sectional study; the title is specific about a different psychiatric disorder (e.g., personality disorder, depression, bulimia) without a trauma sample; the title is about a protocol.
Do not exclude the papers if the title includes general mental health terms such as: mental problems or disorders; psychopathology; psychiatric disorders or symptoms; distress; stress. Do not exclude papers if the title includes concepts that may overlap with PTSD such as: posttraumatic growth; moral injury or distress; trauma or peritraumatic; population likely exposed to trauma (e.g., military, refugee, etc.); serious health condition (e.g. COVID, cancer, etc.); compassion fatigue; secondary traumatic stress; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI); bereavement or grief.
BE CONSERVATIVE!!! I prefer including papers by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.
